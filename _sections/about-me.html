<h2><strong>JAROME LESLIE</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Data Scientist / Consultant / Energy Market Analyst</strong></p>

<p align="left">Hi! My name is Jarome Leslie and I’m a driven and creative Data Scientist keen to apply my skills in the areas of tech, climate change, cybersecurity, and space. I currently work as a Data Analyst in the Enterprise Protect team of TD Bank where I develop new and automate existing risk reporting analysis pipelines. Prior to this role, I worked as a Data Scientist for a Vancouver tech start-up – Lightspark. My path into Data Science came through graduating from UBC’s Master of Data Science 2020 cohort, after working for five years in consulting focused on energy markets and renewable energy at London Economics International.</p>
